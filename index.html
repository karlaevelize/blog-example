            <h2>Why we love them?</h2>
            <p>The first reason is because they are delicious, they are the perfect combination of meat, cheese, bacon and egg. Also, you can easily make one and it doesn't take a lot of time. It's also amazing how every burger is unique and a different chef always means a different burger!</p>
